## Slider


Run `python slider.py` with no arguments. The slider will appear in a pygame
window. After selecting your preference, press `SPACE` on your keyboard. In the
terminal, the information gain will be printed in descending order for each
interface configuration. The optimal 3 choose 2 interface configuration is the
first configuration that contains a single `-1`: this is the optimal
configuration for the user. 

If the user 'misclicks', just press `n` in the terminal when it asks if you are
done. Be sure to log what the optimal configuration for the user is! If you
want, I can add a logfile so that it saves this information to the harddrive.
